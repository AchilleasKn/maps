# Maps for Data Visualisation

Welcome to my GEOJSON maps repository! 

Here, you will find high-quality maps of various countries and their subdivisions, which can be used for a range of applications such as data visualization, geographic analysis, and spatial modelling. All maps are available in the GEOJSON format, which is a flexible and widely-used open standard for encoding geographic data.

In this repository, I provide detailed maps for several countries, including their states, provinces, and other administrative subdivisions. The maps are created using reliable sources of geographic data, ensuring that they are accurate and up-to-date.

Feel free to use these maps and contribute to the repository by submitting your own GEOJSON files or suggesting improvements to existing maps. I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring and analysing geographic data.

A great tool for loading, compressing and exporting GEOJSON maps is [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/).
